# GIT Basics
This is a tool used to interact with your codebase and you can track your codebase changes.

## Importances of GIT
- Track your code changes
- Commit(save) your changes
- Connect your local repo to your cloud(remote) repo e.g github
- Help to push your codes to the remote repo
- Help you to pull your codes from the remote repo
- Clone your remote repo to your local computer

## Set up git
1. Set your name like this 
```bash
git config --global user.name "Katelyn Ridener"
```
2. Set your email
```bash
git config --global user.email "ridener@gmail.com"
```

## Initializing git
```bash
git init
```
if you do the above git will start tracking changes in your codes and now you are able to use git

## Important commands
1.  `git add .` (this will help you to add your files to the track area)
2. `git commit` -m "a description of what you're saving"
3. `git push` pushes the saved version of your codes
